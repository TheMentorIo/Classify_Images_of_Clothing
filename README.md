# Classify Images of Clothing

Welcome to the "Classify Images of Clothing" project! This repository contains a machine learning model and associated tools for classifying images of clothing items into predefined categories. The goal is to provide an accurate and efficient way to categorize clothing images, which can be useful for various applications such as fashion e-commerce, inventory management, and more.

## Project Overview

The project leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify images of clothing into categories like T-shirts, pants, dresses, and more. It uses a dataset of clothing images to train and evaluate the model.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Classify clothing images into predefined categories.
- **Model Training**: Train a deep learning model using a CNN architecture.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assess the performance of the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Visualization**: Visualize predictions and performance metrics.

## Dataset

The project uses the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist) which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of 10 clothing categories.
